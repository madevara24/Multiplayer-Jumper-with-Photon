This is a multiplayer jumper/platformer game for android built with unity, photon, and google play apis (integrated with google play). The objective is to survive as long as you can by jumping from platform to platform using accelerometer to steer the player sideways (jump is automatic when you touch a platform). I make this as a final project for a class i'm taking in univ.
